/**
 * This package contains the api interface for components.
 *
 * <p>There are three main types of components in Annot8:
 *
 * <p>1) Source - these produce new items for processing 2) Processor - these process items, for
 * example by adding annotations 3) Resource - these are reusable classes that can be used by other
 * components
 *
 * <p>Descriptors are used to describe and create components, and provide information about the
 * capabilities of a component (Which may be configuration dependent)
